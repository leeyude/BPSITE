                    <highlight>18. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dispute Resolution And Arbitration</highlight>
                  </p>

                  <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH BABY’S PUREST AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.1. Binding Arbitration</highlight></p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of Section 10 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Baby’s Purest agree (a) to waive your and Baby’s Purest’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms, or the Sites, Content or Products, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive your and Baby’s Purest’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Baby’s Purest agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">You and Baby’s Purest agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Sites, Content or Products is personal to you and Baby’s Purest and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and Baby’s Purest agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Baby’s Purest agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>


                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.3. Federal Arbitration Act</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">You and Baby’s Purest agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 18 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">You and Baby’s Purest agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Baby’s Purest shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Baby Purest, LLC.  Baby’s Purest, LLC., Attn: General Counsel, 4175 Whitmore Lake Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Baby’s Purest account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically in accordance with Section 3 and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and Baby’s Purest cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Baby’s Purest may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 18, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 18.1, file a claim in court.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.5. Process</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 10 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Baby’s Purest agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or Baby’s Purest within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and Baby’s Purest will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute). You and Baby’s Purest agree that (a) any arbitration will shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Michigan and the United States, respectively, sitting in the Circuit Court for the County of Washtenaw, State of Michigan or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of Michigan and the United States, respectively, sitting in the Circuit Court for the County of Washtenaw, State of Michigan or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.6. Authority of Arbitrator</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"> As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight> 18.7. Rules of JAMS</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.8. Severability</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">If any term, clause or provision of this Section 18 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 18 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 18.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><highlight>18.9. Opt-Out Right</highlight></p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 60px;">You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 18 by writing to: Baby’s Purest, Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 5 Crosby Street, New York, NY 10013. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 19.</p>

                  <p>
                    <highlight>19. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Governing Law and Venue</highlight>
                  </p>

                  <p>These Terms, your access to and use of the Sites and your order, receipt and use of the Products shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Michigan or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Michigan and the United States, respectively, sitting in the Circuit Court for the County of Washtenaw, State of Michigan or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.</p>

                  <p>

                    <highlight>21. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Severability</highlight>
                  </p>

                  <p>If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.</p>

                  <p>
                    <highlight>22. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Survival</highlight>
